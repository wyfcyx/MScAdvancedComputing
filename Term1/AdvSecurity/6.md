# blockchain security

blockchain->distributed trust(integrity,accountability?)

blockchain->decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger

why blockchain?; **double-spending problem**(digital duplicatable) leads to inflation;

blockchain hasn't solved yet: privacy/throughput/other properties: auditability/availability/non-repudiation

killer app: cryptographic money; no need approving; can remain largely anonymous; transactions cannot be reverted;

consensus building: proof of work(PoW) etc.

51% attacks which can achieve double-spending, Bitcoin Gold was hacked in 2018

BC components: digital ledger(record); consensus(verify each transaction, keep integrity of the BC); digital assets; network participants

increase min confirmation??? to at least 100 can mitigate 51% attack

decentralization of BC: miners! Eth more centralized then BTC; 90% of BTC power is controlled by 16 miners

attack possibilities:

Wallet DNS Hack/ HW wallet good!

smart contracts: atomicity

EVM: Ethereum is a decentralized VM; contracts are written in bytecodes; each function are executed by all miners ideally, and miners are incentivized by execution fees paid by users; fees can also prevent DoS
