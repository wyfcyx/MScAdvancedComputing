drive-by attack: attack after users download some specifically prepared files

example: heap spraying, jump to mali code, full one block(fill with nop operations), just create possibilities

real-world example: check versions of underlaying SW and then attack, multiple exploits

why plugins are more effective????

obfuscation: generate code to be executed later on runtime

malzila: explore malicious webpages

runtime obfuscation: runtime code unfolding

detecting internet malware: dynamic(nozzle)/static detection(zozzle)

dynamic: scan heap objs for x86 objs

static: analyze js code in terms of abstract grammar tree to find some specific patterns



web security; possible attacks: network(passive: eavesdropper; active: evil router, DNS poisoning)/webpage attackers

browser attacker: breaks browser's isolation, connection between web security and low-level memory-based exploitation



cookie: HTTP stateless, cookie add states

cookie-based authentication???? not sure!

browsers store cookies

cookies are sent through HTTP(not secure) by browsers, no integrity

httponly cookies: cannot accessed by scripts e.g. `document.cookie`, but cannot stop the XSS bugs



frame and content isolation

a browser window contains different frames from different sources(content are delegated), which are isolated from each other(like processes in OS)

OS vs. browsers: users->origins, buffer overflow->cross site scripting/SQL injections...(vulnerabilities)

isolation goals: access multiple pages/frames at the same time safely

origin of each frame: `<protocol:/host:port>`, frame can access its own unique origin(network, DOM, storage such as cookies)

frame-frame relationships, `CanScript(A,B), CanNavigate(A, B)`, frame can access other frame's origin!

library imports `<src=http://...>`???

domain relexation?

additional mechanisms:

frame busting: if loaded in another frame, show some information



content security policy(CSP)

X-Content-Sec-Pol default-src: ...; img-src:...; object-src:...; script-src:...;

XHR: XMLHttpRequest and CSP

CORS: cross-origin resource sharing such as fonts/images/videos and other resources



communicating: inter-frame communication, new APIs provides by browsers



punycode attack??? hack unicode chars in the URL, look the same but are different in browsers' respective
