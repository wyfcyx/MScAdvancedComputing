constraints: read after write, write after read(the register shouldn't be overwritten too early), write after write,

ID->IS(Issue), RO(wait until no data hazards, read operands)

not enough regs: mem to save value temp; cannot reorder operations to avoid some hazards at the SW lvl

so, dyn scheduling at HW lvl!

tomasulo's algorithm

every kind of res has multiple copies, each copy with a RS(reservation station) which is a place holder containing only one instruction that want to use this res

every reg has its value and tag which indicates that which res is used to produce its value, if not, then NULL, which means that it's safe to take the value of this reg without any hazards

issue in order, collect operands status, allocate res through RS, copy operands from regfile, update reg tag

when taking a source reg whose tag isn't null, then we can send the tag to the RS, which indicates that where the actual value can be found

when updating a non-NULL tag, just overwrite it

when instruction completes: *common data bus!* This data bus can transfer data from functional units to both regfiles and RS. functional unit broadcast the produced value and its tag on the bus, the reg which is listening to this tag can update its value and tag, and RS which is also listening this tag can fill the operands and be able let the instruction to execute(**directly, not need to ask regfile**, kinda forwarding).

reg: connection between instructions! rather than a store location

drawbacks: too complex/ high requirement of the CDB's bandwidth since we need broadcasting(CDB is even more complicated in a multi-issue processor)/non-precise interrupts

example: tomasulo allow multiple iterations in a loop to run parallelly
