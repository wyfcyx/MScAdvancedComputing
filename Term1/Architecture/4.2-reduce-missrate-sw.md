software prefetching instructions on simple processors; such as memcpy; do not use them on today's well-designed CPUs; if use, mention side-effects or page faults;

reducing i-cache misses; McFarling; link-time opt; reorder procedures in memory layout based on call graph so that procedures are called in the same loop do not conflict with each other(reduce associativity misses)

data side: storage layout(don't change the code, cannot change temporal, focus on spatial, limited cap)/iteration space transformation(change the order of the iterations, temporal & spatial)

Array of Structs or SoA, `merge { int val, int key}[SIZE]`(better if hashing where key is calculated) or 2 arrays(better if iterate over keys to find a value); another example: MM ex

Morton-order(like a recursive quadtree order), Z matrix layout, compromise between the best and worst case; dimension in a cache line; core idea: perf is very bad when users make minor mistakes

MM: loop interchange

loop fusion: merge loops if their bounds are the same, improve spatial locality(I think it's temporal locality?), another 'transpose'; array contraction: array to scalar, example: use registers to store temporal values, do not always access the memory, another example: rolling array that is commonly used(important in image-processing filters, etc.); adapt to some problems by shifting;

conclusion: design algorithms considering the cache(how the data moves); compiler's job to improve the data layout; programming abstractions for data locality
