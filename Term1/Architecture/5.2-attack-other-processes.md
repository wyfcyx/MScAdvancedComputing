attack other processes/OS, steal data

review spectre variant-1, core idea: cannot cancel cache allocations if a branch misprediction is detected

spectre variant 1 is universal among many different platforms; cannot trust language-based confidentiality due to it



OS/app pages in the single app address space; OS pages can be attacked from app side using spectre variant 1; what make things worse is that some OS pages are directly mapped to the physical memory, which means that the whole physical memory can also be attacked

diagram based on VIPT(L1 cache & DTLB) with access validity checks(after DTLB); if a va is invalid, the related insn will be marked a invalid and will throw an exception thus it cannot be committed, it is OK!; but we are assuming micro-states which not explicitly mentioned in the ISA manual cannot be observable, actually they are!;

ASLR can mitigate meltdown since attacked should guess where the kernel pages are in the address space, but only a little

what really helps: Kernel Page Table Isolation; works but 2%-30% slower due to TLB reloading, slighted improved using ASID



how to defeat isolation(spectre variant 2): find a gadget in the kernel such like this

```c
label:
  s = *p; // s is secret
  r = B[(s & 1) * 16];
```

train branch predictor to jump to `label`(using system calls, indirect jumps when accessing syscall table); observe `B` in terms of cache allocation, but we cannot observe it directions, instead we observe a user-space data structure which conflicts with `B`

how to mitigate spectre variant 2; hard to rebuild arch to eliminate all side-channels; add noise to timers to mess with cache probing, but not effective; add new insn which blocks branch predictions, think where it should be used; block branch predictor contention: for example per-process branch predictor



mitigating spectre using retpolines; idea: whether mispredict or not, it cannot be influenced by attackers;
