we don't like branch stall anymore!

branch target buffer(BTB), IF stage(when we are trying to find the next PC, if not a branch we don't use BTB), instruction PC->which PC to jump to, update when a direct/indirect jump occurs

when to predict the target: after we fetch the instruction, but even before we know it is a conditional jump or virtual call/return

branch misprediction: can be detected during decoding, squash it, allow it to run continuously, but cannot write to memory or any registers 

combine direction and target prediction: in parallel, work together to determine next PC is current PC + instruction size or something else

multiple predicators: slow predicator run in parallel and is able to correct the prediction

update the branch prediction earlier or later???

return address; `ret`; return address is different when the function is called from a different location; maybe mis-predict; should be handled by ISA, x86->address stack top, MIPS->jal instruction and $ra reg; form a stack, this can be used to improve prediction

RAP, return address predicator; has a small stack; extend BTB to predict if it's a RA, if it's, pop an entry from RAP; update: after detecting misprediction and not a misprediction, call->push, ret->pop from RAP;

misprediction from RAP: RAP size is limited, default from BTB but not good; we've changed the $ra or sp, maybe we've switched to another thread; when to update???
