tutorial3-7: accept a worse solution if $z_k\leq e^{\Delta/T_k}$, order of neighbor???

tutorial4-3: Hu's; prioritize in the ready queue; $q\in{[1,L]}$ï¼Œ $m-1<\max_{q}x_q\leq m$ rather than $< m$!

Muntz: try to find job to fill all the machines only if its $\alpha_j$ is exactly one lvl lower and it's ready
