MongoDB is a great example!

motivation

problem of SQL: rigid schema, cannot scale, unintuitive

MongoDB: API for many PLs, run anywhere, absorb many advantages from RDBMSs and NOSQL

document-based(max16MiB); BSON file format(field-value pairs, like XML); stored in a collection(like a table, but more flexible, has indexes)

BSON->binary coding of JSON(Javascript Object Notation, with KV and ordered list); `_id` field like primary key in SQL; 'prejoin' unlike SQL

CRUD using the shell; insert; query(and/or/in range[a,b]); updating; removal; atomicity only on the document lvl

Mongo is basically schema-free; flexible; downside: sometimes something isn't clear

patterns: embedding(pre-join)/linking 

one2one mapping: merging docs instead of leave them isolated

one2many mapping: embeddings, but replication; here linking is better like RDBMS, application code is complex



pros: easy-to-use interface `find`; data locality, high speed!

index: we don't want to scan all the documents!; single/compound field indexes

aggregate: pipeline of operations
