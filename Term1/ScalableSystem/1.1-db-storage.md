database management software stack/modules

focus: buffer/disk space manage(usually under OS)

simple search engine, no transactions since only support read only operations

dbms implement its own fs(including buffer/disk space management) instead of deriving from OS since it knows more about what it is doing than OS thus can be more efficient, e.g.:

* specialized prefetching
* control cache replacement policy/thread scheduling/how to implement WAL

something about the disk

why persistent storage is required: although main-memory db do exist!(smaller size, volatility is permitted)

flash: not widely used for db

storage hierarchy

info about disks: structure

accessing a disk page: disk head seek time, rotation time, cost of moving data(transfer time)

seek time: curve has a flat area in the beginning of the seeking distance due to the increase of the data density of the tracks, in the future the flat area will become bigger(?)

> have a look at the settle time

seek time:1~20ms, rotation: 0~10ms, transfer: <1ms for 4KiB

reducing seeking time and rotation delay is critical

prefetching is important

defrag, do not make sense on ssd, important on disks since sequential read has higher perf

disk block has more than one neighbour, 'logically'

summary: data that are queried together should be stored together; try to rely on sequential IO;



Q1: is DBMS like a kinda fs?



I'm not sure what is settle time/cylinder
