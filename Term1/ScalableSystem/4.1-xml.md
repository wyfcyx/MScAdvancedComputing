store XML in relational DBMSs

xml introduction: advantages/grammars/tag trees; whether XML is well-formed: Document Type Definition(DTD) like DB schema, father and children, limitation of the count of occurrence of the children under his parent

storing; Java; parse to .xls maybe

importance: transfer between different systems, deeply integrated into some workflows/frameworks

storing: structure(based on understanding of DTD)/model-mapping approach(don't care DTD, fixed pattern, cons: flexibility, independent to DTD, don't need to modify DBMS)

### model-mapping

edge-oriented: edge/monet/xparent

node-oriented:

key terms: ordinal(order among all its sibilings), labeled-path(A.B.C), data-path(&1.&3.&7, each is a ordinal)

edge approach: edge(src,ordinal,target,label,flag,value); precise; single table

monet approach: multiple-table; partitioned labeled-paths(queries are related to labeled-paths); element(edge) and text nodes(leaves)

Xrel approach: 4 tables; path/element/text(store values for elements)/attribute(values for nodes)

Xparent: 4 tables; label path(ID, Len, Path); DataPath(ParentID, ChildrenID); Element; Data



Querying: we want to reduce the joins to improve efficiency depending on the query patterns; XRel/Xparent for complex; edge for simple queries; labeled-paths can help reducing querying time

On class:

ordinal -> makes sense when querying the first etc.
