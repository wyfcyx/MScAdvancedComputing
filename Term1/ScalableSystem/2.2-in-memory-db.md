OLTP vs OLAP, OLAP: large data; long run; complex queries; most RO, OLTP: small updates; fewer table; generated queries

TP db size: 1TB is very big but affordable(64GB per server on 16 servers, but several PBs for a AP database), so they can fit into main mem

TP db perf: latching/locking/buffer pool/logging 24%, useful work->4%

optimize B Tree-> it's not the bottleneck(only 4% path), so considering the buffer pool is a good idea!(move it onto main mem)

OldSQL -> cannot scale well

## NoSQL

NoSQL -> no sql/ACID, so give up transactions cuz it's hard to make transactions both distributed and efficient; NewSQL in this lec

effect of no sql: parser, translating SQL into lower level operations, is complex, it's also hard to efficiently correctly executing the operations, not convenient for developers; 

effect of no ACID: hard to bring ACID back, so think twice before choosing no ACID

why we need ACID: limited res such as travel booking, and can roll back if something has gone wrong

NoSQL summary: perfect if not need transactions, cannot fit TP database well

## NewSQL

sql -> a language, efficient and scalable under the help of modern HW

solutions for the previous bottlenecks: locking/buffer pool/latching(higher latency is accepted)/WAL(another efficient recovering mechanism)

example: VoltDB, main mem storage, 1 thread(no locking/latching), internal availability and ... no based on logging, 95% useful work

 details: partitioned/replicated tables(for static data)

single partition operations/multiple partition operations(sometimes need locking)

compile -> distribute to machines

async client

Q3: how VoltDB store data or screenshot persistently

client cannot ask a operation that has been executed to rollback

lack of concurrency, optimized for throughput rather than latency, most of the time the latency may be good and there aren't much operations waiting in the queue cuz operations are all short, but you should mind it, good for OLTP

can modify scheme -> recompile
