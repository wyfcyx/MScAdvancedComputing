[another overview from SGX101](https://sgx101.gitbook.io/sgx101/sgx-bootstrap/overview)

## Introduction

how to defense against the admin which is under control of a malicious party

SGX's security mechanism: Trusted Computing Base, Hardware secrets, Remote Attestation, Sealed Storage, Memory Encryption

* TCB: SW/HW related to SGX
* Hardware secrets: Root Provisioning Key(RPK, is known to Intel) and Root Seal Key(RSK, is not, most keys are derived from RSK)
* Remote Attestation: client prove to the service provider "that an enclave is running a given software, inside a given CPU, with a given security level, for a given Individual Software Vender (ISV)"
* Sealed Storage: When storing secrets provided by service providers to untrusted media, they should be encrypted before. Data and code inside an enclave are not secrets, what is really important are the data from service providers.
* Memory Encryption: isolated encrypted memory

Application design: trusted(run in enclaves)/untrusted components

Attestation: prove that the enclave contains specific code and data; local attestation: 2 enclaves on the same platform verify each other; remote attestation

Sealing: encrypt the secrets before they are written to untrusted media, later they can be decrypted by the CPU, but the keys are now known to enclaves

## Enclaves

enclaves' code and data, Processor Reserved Memory(PRM), a subset of DRAM, direct accesses of other SW except for enclaves are rejects by CPU

Enclave Page Cache(EPC), a part of PRM, contains multiple 4KiB pages, which may be allocated to different enclaves, EPC is managed by system software such as OS/Hypervisor, but only allocate/free EPC pages, they can not directly access EPC pages since they are not enclaves

Enclave Page Cache Map(EPCM), like page table, each entry -> {Valid bit, PT(Page Type), ENCLAVESECS(exclusive owner of this page)}; Page Types: `PT_REG`, regular, enclaves' code and data; `PT_SECS` holds SGX Enclave Control Structures

SGX Enclave Control Structure(SECS): allocate SECS page for an enclave->use the enclave->free the SECS page; SGX instructions take VA of SECS as input to access SECS(a page of the EPC), thus the system software should add the mapping to the page table, however the system SW cannot access the SECS; enclave code also cannot the SECS of the enclave

Enclave Virtual Memory: a virtual address in the Enclave Linear RANGE(ELRANGE, BASEADDR+SIZE, which is a power of 2, stored in enclave's SECS)->page table maintained by the system SW->a physical page of EPC of PRM of DRAM; VA outside ELRANGE->translation->PA outside PRM

SGX Enclave Attributes, that is, SECS.ATTRIBUTES, {DEBUG:1, XFRM:64, MODE64BIT: 1}, DEBUG should be set to zero in production, when enclave's code is executing, register XCR0 is set to XFRM;

Address translation: using the same page table(untrusted) as the host application's, thus SGX may be under the exposure of address translation attacks, the protection mechanism: when an EPC page is allocated, EPCM entry of this page.{ADDRESS,R,W,X} are set where ADDRESS is the intended virtual address to access this page, only this VA can be used to access the EPC page

Thread Control Structure(TCS), multiple logical processors execute the same enclave's code at the same time, each logical processor->a EPC page whose type(can be found in an EPCM entry) is PT_TCS

State Save Area(SSA), used for saving the thread execution context(contains both GP registers of the results of the `XSAVE` instruction which used requested-feature bitmap(RFBM)) of an enclave when an hardware exception occurs, in the enclave's virtual address space, each SSA multiple EPC pages, multiple SSAs and a TCS(serves as the metadata of the SSAs) *per thread*,
