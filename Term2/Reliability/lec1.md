approaches for improving SW reliability:

* manual testing(high effort, no unusual combinations which leads to arithmetic overflows or UBs)
* follow coding standards
* code review
* tool support

course focus: bug-finding methods, runtime security techniques(prevent attacks at runtime) and dynamic/static analysis

mostly based on research papers

prioritize reducing false positives(bugs are *diseases*) over reducing false negatives

sound: never report false negatives

complete: never report false positives
