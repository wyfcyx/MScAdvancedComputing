hash of the block is the hash of the block header

reward is paid by the coinbase transaction

unite into mining pools

BTC's difficulty, more difficult than pools' difficulty, pool members are paid if they find a nonce which satisfies a looser constraint

merged mining: mine multiple blockchains at the same time

mining pool dangers: 51%, inflate transaction fees/gas prices; other dangers: network attacks, pool operators, etc.

decentralized mining pool: p2pool, do not need to trust pool operators

smart contract: application layer over blockchain layer,

hard fork: using new rules

soft fork???

segregated witness: separate signature from transactions

miners vote on BIP through their implementation

other Proofs: Proof of stake, Delegated PoS, Proof of authority; PoS: select proposer randomly, enough validators attest the block, penalty...

PoS increases scalability, whether it reduces centralization?

Q&A:

merged mining: 

main chain: longest with the most difficulty, *target* which controls the difficulty is in the block header, there is also a timestamp in the block header, 2016 blocks in 14 days if 1 block/10min, adjust the target every period(14 days), 

fork(do not forget there are 2 chains now!): advantage, better decentralization; disadvantage: divide hashing power, more easily to 51% attack

smart contract of bitcoins does not support loops!

miner will firstly collect the transaction with higher transaction fees
